The **bapsflib** package is developed on Python 3.7+ and is intended to 
be a toolkit for reading, manipulating, and analyzing data collected at 
the Basic Plasma Science Facility 
([BaPSF](http://plasma.physics.ucla.edu/)) at UCLA. 

The current development cycle is focused on providing a high-level, 
structured interface between the user and the HDF5 files generated from
experiments on the Large Plasma Device (LaPD).  This interface 
leverages [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/).
