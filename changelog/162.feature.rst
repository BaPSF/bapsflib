Reworked algorithm of `build_shotnum_dset_relation` to handle
HDF5 datasets that have data for control device configuration saved
sequentially; that is, all of configuration 1 is written to the dataset
then all of configuration 2 is saved to the dataset, and so on.  As a
result of the rework, helper functions ``build_sndr_for_simple_dset`` and
``build_sndr_for_complex_dset`` were removed.
