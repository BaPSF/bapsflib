Added GitHub Action :file:`tests.yml` for testing of pushes to
``master``, version tags, pull requests, and cron jobs every Sunday
at 3:13 am PT.  Tests are setup to run on the latest versions of
ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows.  Tests are setup to run on
Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.  Tests also run on min versions of
`h5py` (``v2.8.0``) and `numpy` (``v1.14``).
