About :mod:`bapsflib`
=====================

The :mod:`bapsflib` Python package is intended to be a toolkit for reading,
manipulating, and analyzing data collected at the Basic Plasma Science
Facility (BaPSF).  The current development focuses on providing a
high-level, structured interface between the user and the HDF5 files
generated by the Large Plasma Device (LaPD).  The :mod:`bapsflib.lapd`
module provides all the high-level methods while maintaining the
not-so-lower "lower level" functionality of the
`h5py <http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ package.

As the package develops, additional data visualization and plasma
analysis tools will be incorporated.
