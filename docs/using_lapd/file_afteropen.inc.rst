.. py:currentmodule:: bapsflib.lapd

Upon opening a file, :class:`~File` calls on the
:class:`~_hdf.lapdmap.LaPDMap` class
(a subclass of :class:`~bapsflib._hdf.maps.hdfmap.HDFMap`) to construct
a mapping of the HDF5 file's internal data structure.  This mapping
provides the necessary translation for the high-level data reading
methods, :meth:`~File.read_data`, :meth:`~File.read_controls`, and
:meth:`~File.read_msi`.  If an element of the HDF5 file
is un-mappable -- a mapping module does not exist or the mapping
fails -- the data can still be reached using the not-so-lower
inherited methods of :class:`h5py.File`.  An instance of the mapping
object is bound to :class:`File` as
:attr:`~File.file_map` ::

    >>> from bapsflib import lapd
    >>> from bapsflib._hdf import HDFMap
    >>> f = lapd.File('test.hdf5')
    >>> f.file_map
    <LaPDMap of HDF5 file 'test.hdf5'>
    >>>
    >>> # is still an instance of HDFMap
    >>> isinstance(f.file_map, HDFMap)
    True

For details on how the mapping works and how the mapping objects are
structured see :ref:`hdfmap_details`.  For details on using the
:attr:`~File.file_map` see :ref:`file_map` for details.

The opened file object (``f``) provides a set of high-level methods and
attributes for th user to interface with, see :numref:`f_meth_table`.
