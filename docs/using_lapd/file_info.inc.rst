Every time a HDF5 file is opened a dictionary of metadata about the file
and the experiment is bound to the file object as
:attr:`~bapsflib.lapd.File.info`.

.. code-block:: python3

    >>> f = lapd.File('test.hdf5')
    >>> f.info
    {'absolute file path': '/foo/bar/test.hdf5',
     'exp description': 'this is an experiment description',
      ...
      'run status': 'Started'}

Table :numref:`f_info_table` lists and describes all the items that can
be found in the info dictionary.

.. _f_info_table:

.. csv-table:: Items in the ``f.info`` dictionary.
